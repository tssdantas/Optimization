## Optimization Portfolio

This repository contains a porfolio of optimization code created to showcase some of my knowledge in this subject.

## Contents
- ### Optimization of a test function in the C++ language.
    -  [Simulated Annealing](https://github.com/tssdantas/Optimization_Portfolio/tree/main/SimulatedAnnealing) An algorithm in C++11 was built from scratch to implement the Simulated Annealing optimization method, which can be classied as a stochastic, heuristic and a global optimization approach. A two dimensional Rastrigin test funtion with an optimum solution in x = (0, 0) was used for demonstration purposes. 
    -  [Integration of external optimization package](https://github.com/tssdantas/Optimization_Portfolio/tree/main/nlopt) This algorithm showcases the integration of an external optimization package [NLopt](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to solve the same problem with the Rastrigin test function.
